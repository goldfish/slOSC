fix disconnect so it sends final osc messages before disconnect
process /tap_temp update. dump it or find out why it's being sent... maybe flash the tap tempo toggle like slgui.
move processing of incoming OSC from removed internal patches into the new external patches. Not a rush, since it doesn't really do anything extra if no messages are coming in anyway.
